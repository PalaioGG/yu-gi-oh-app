# YuGiOhApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Development Process

First, `deck` and `card` class models were defined and developed. 
Next, the `cards-list` component and `deck` service.
Next, created the `card-information` component. 
This is the basic logic of the controllers.

During these stages, code was revised and refactored.

The UI was developed last, with responsiveness in mind.
Added a `toggleable` directive for the `deck` sidebar.
Lastly, updated the details and did some refactoring.

Unit testing development was not driven by some specific strategy.
It's mostly the developer's attempt in unit testing.
